              mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated but include
              promoting immune escape. Here we investigated associations between
              virus-positivity and immune pathway alteration for 2009 tumors
              across six virus-related cancer types. Analysis revealed that for
              3 of 72 human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous
              cell carcinoma (HNSC) the HPV genome integrated in immune
              checkpoint genes PD-L1 or PD-L2, driving elevated expression in
              the corresponding gene. In addition to the previously described
              upregulation of the PD-1 immunosuppressive pathway in Epstein-Barr
              virus (EBV)-positive stomach tumors, we also observed upregulation
              of the PD-1 pathway in cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive tumors.
              Furthermore, we found signatures of T-cell and B-cell response in
              HPV-positive HNSC and EBV-positive stomach tumors and HPV-positive
              HNSC patients were associated with better survival when T-cell

               transposase-accessible chromatin) from 225 samples and matched

               Among epigenetically altered pathways, TP53, hypoxia and TNF

               dysregulated during tumor development and is closely intertwined

               profiling of 687 tumors and matched non-involved adjacent tissues
               from the kidney, brain, pancreas, lung, head and neck, and

              small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and an
              ATP-independent function of unknown mechanism. Prp5 has also been
              implicated in proofreading the branch site sequence, but the
              molecular mechanism has not been well characterized. Using actin
              precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) carrying branch site mutations, we
              identified a Prp5-containing prespliceosome with Prp5 directly
              bound to U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Prp5 is in contact with U2
              in regions on and near the branchpoint-interacting stem-loop
              (BSL), suggesting that Prp5 may function in stabilizing the BSL.
              Regardless of its ATPase activity, Prp5 mutants that suppress
              branch site mutations associate with the spliceosome less tightly
              and allow more tri-snRNP binding for the reaction to proceed. Our

              prespliceosome formation and proofreading of the branch site
              sequence. Prp5 binds to the spliceosome in association with U2 by
              interacting with the BSL and is released upon the base-pairing of
              U2 with the branch site to allow the recruitment of the tri-snRNP.
              Mutations impairing U2-branch site base-pairing retard Prp5
              release and impede tri-snRNP association. Prp5 mutations that
              destabilize the Prp5-U2 interaction suppress branch site mutations

  abstract = "We present a proteogenomic study of 108 human papilloma virus
              (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs).
              Proteomic analysis systematically catalogs HNSCC-associated
              proteins and phosphosites, prioritizes copy number drivers, and
              highlights an oncogenic role for RNA processing genes. Proteomic
              investigation of mutual exclusivity between FAT1 truncating
              mutations and 11q13.3 amplifications reveals dysregulated actin
              dynamics as a common functional consequence. Phosphoproteomics
              characterizes two modes of EGFR activation, suggesting a new
              strategy to stratify HNSCCs based on EGFR ligand abundance for
              effective treatment with inhibitory EGFR monoclonal antibodies.
              Widespread deletion of immune modulatory genes accounts for low
              immune infiltration in immune-cold tumors, whereas concordant
              upregulation of multiple immune checkpoint proteins may underlie
              resistance to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monotherapy in
              immune-hot tumors. Multi-omic analysis identifies three molecular
              subtypes with high potential for treatment with CDK inhibitors,
              anti-EGFR antibody therapy, and immunotherapy, respectively.
              Altogether, proteogenomics provides a systematic framework to
              inform HNSCC biology and treatment.",

  abstract = "Gene fusions represent an important class of somatic alterations
              in cancer. We systematically investigated fusions in 9,624 tumors
              across 33 cancer types using multiple fusion calling tools. We
              identified a total of 25,664 fusions, with a 63\% validation rate.
              Integration of gene expression, copy number, and fusion annotation
              data revealed that fusions involving oncogenes tend to exhibit
              increased expression, whereas fusions involving tumor suppressors
              have the opposite effect. For fusions involving kinases, we found
              1,275 with an intact kinase domain, the proportion of which varied
              significantly across cancer types. Our study suggests that fusions
              drive the development of 16.5\% of cancer cases and function as
              the sole driver in more than 1\% of them. Finally, we identified
              druggable fusions involving genes such as TMPRSS2, RET, FGFR3,
              ALK, and ESR1 in 6.0\% of cases, and we predicted immunogenic
              peptides, suggesting that fusions may provide leads for targeted
              drug and immune therapy.",
