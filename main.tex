\item \textbf{New York University \& New York Genome Center} \hfill New York, NY\\
Postdoctoral research associate, \href{http://sanjanalab.org/}{Laboratory of Neville Sanjana } \hfill
2021--Present
\begin{detaillist}
    \item \textit{\textbf{Transcriptome-scale RNA-targeting CRISPR screens reveal essential lncRNAs in human cells:}} Conducted Cas13 pooled screens and perturbation assays, coupled with single-cell RNA sequencing, to identify and characterize hundreds of lncRNAs crucial for cell proliferation and their mechanistic roles.
    \item \textit{\textbf{High-content CRISPR screens identify lncRNAs modulate CAR-macrophages in tumor microenvironment:}} Implemented \textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo} screens to discover lncRNAs that promote a pro-inflammatory microenvironment in BRCA xenograft and BRCA organoid models. 
\end{detaillist}

\item \textbf{Washington University in St. Louis} \hfill St. Louis, MO\\
Ph.D. student and postdoctoral research associate, \href{https://dinglab.wustl.edu/}{Laboratory of Li Ding } \hfill
2015--2021
\begin{detaillist}
    \item \textit{\textbf{Epigenetic regulation during cancer transitions across 11 tumour types:}} Utilized snATAC sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and bulk whole-exome sequencing data from the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) to profile over a million cells or nuclei. Identified cancer-specific accessible region dynamics correlating with gene expression, uncovering novel regulatory regions and their target genes.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Integrative multi-omic cancer profiling reveals DNA methylation patterns associated with therapeutic vulnerability and cell-of-origin:}} Leveraged DNA methylation, RNA sequencing, and proteomic data from the Clinical Proteogenomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) to elucidate how epigenetic changes in cancer cells influence gene expression, protein levels, tumor characteristics, and therapeutic responses.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Driver fusions and their implications in the development and treatment of human cancers:}} Conducted comprehensive analysis of gene fusions in over 9,000 tumors across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), uncovering how these fusions drive the expression of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and kinases. Identified druggable fusions in 6.0\% of cases, highlighting their potential as targets for precision therapies.
